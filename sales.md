## Introduction
This page is intended to provide insight, guidance and resoureces for partner sales teams to leverage in first understanding then positioning Windows Virtual Desktop as a key service to help customers become enabled for remote work.  

## Overview
Windows Virtual Desktop (WVD) is a service exclusive to Microsoft Azure which allows remote user access to a managed corporate Windows desktop environment. It provides some compelling key benefits over traditional (on-premises) virtual desktop infrastructure (VDI) services and competing services from other cloud vendors.

## Costs
The cost to the customer for WVD is composed of 3 elements:
1. The Azure costs to host the "session host" virtual machines as well as any supporting infrastructure
2. The Microsoft 365 license cost for end-user access to the service
3. The license costs for control plane access (Citrix & VMWare are licenses separately, Microsoft (Native) control plane is free).
