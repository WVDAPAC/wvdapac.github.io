## Azure Active Directory
When logging into the WVD service, users get authenticated against Azure AD first and their allocated licenses checked there to confirm they are permitted to access the service. Knowledge of how to leverage Azure AD authentication options and security features like password hash authentication, seamless single sign-on, multifactor authentication (MFA), conditional access and more will provide your customers users a better experience while keeping them secure.  


## Active Directory Domain Services
As the session host VMs are required to be Domain-Joined, knowledge of Active Directory capabilities and related features such as Group Policy, DNS, etc is very handy.
